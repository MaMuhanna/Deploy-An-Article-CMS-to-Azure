### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
-  my choice is to go with app service since VMs is more expensive than app service, and app service provides auto-scaling. App service make me focus in devolping the application when AZURE takes care of the infrastructure 
-  support continuous deployment using github which make it simple and fast to deploy. 

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

app service have some limitations such as: the maximum of RAM memory is 14GB if i need a larger memory i would use VM, limited set of programming languages if i am using a fluter for my applicion i can't use app service.
